# Eat-In
A Serverless React SPA, that utilizes AWS to help track how much you don't cook your own food.

## Stack
- Frontend stack can be found in the [/app](https://github.com/misterussell/eat-in/tree/master/app) sub-directory
- The backend stack will be built utilizing the tools and methods from the [Serverless Stack](https://serverless-stack.com/) guide

## Goals
- To understand more about AWS
- To understand the implementation and limitations of create-react-app
- To apply ES6 syntax as possible and required (not going to force it)
